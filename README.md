# Stargazing 2026 Website

This is the official website for the upcoming Regional Gathering of the Greater Los Angeles Metro Area Mensa, taking place in February 2026. The site is being developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and other modern web technologies to provide a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly experience for attendees and organizers alike.
