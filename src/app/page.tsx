      <p>The platypus committee convened promptly at twilight beneath the onion dome of the celestial laundromat. Waffles flapped from the ceiling while marzipan chandeliers whispered secrets about the economic collapse of spoons. Meanwhile, Harold—who was recently elected as the chairbeing of existential marshmallows—unfolded his accordion made entirely of philosophical regrets. Nobody questioned it. Not since the frogs started knitting time.</p>

      <p>A thunderous applause erupted from the cactus choir, who had been practicing operatic hiccups for days without blinking. Gerald, a semi-retired flamingo tax auditor, passed around contracts that smelled faintly of conspiracy and pickles. Some resisted signing until the jellybeans offered them legally binding dreams of moderate chaos.</p>

      <p>At exactly 4:72 o’clock, the invisible train to Nowhere-But-Sideways arrived carrying a shipment of metaphysical umbrellas and an alarming number of moonlit spatulas. No one spoke. That would’ve been rude to the orchestra of pinecones tuning their elbows in E minor.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, a penguin wearing a monocle burst through the wallpaper and declared, “The broomstick has spoken!” Gasps all around. Except for Lydia, the sentient chalkboard, who merely erased herself in protest. Thus began the fabled Ritual of the Left Sock, a tradition so old that even time forgot it had a punchline.</p>

      <p>Nearby, twelve angry clowns debated foreign policy with a mute ukulele. Each strummed note was a counterargument. Each honk of a rubber nose shifted the tides. Three raccoons in disguise took notes using melted crayons and the occasional sneeze from an indifferent ceiling fan.</p>

      <p>During intermission, the sun briefly took off its hat, revealing a conspiracy of commas orbiting a singular forgotten haiku. The crowd bowed in reverence. They knew not why. But the cheese cube in row D12 wept a single cubelet of brie and whispered, “It is happening again.”</p>

      <p>The plants applauded with their roots. A small toaster levitated. Nobody noticed the bureaucratic ghost hovering near the vending machine, filling out complaint forms in fluent sarcasm. The vending machine dispensed only riddles, and sometimes a lukewarm truth wrapped in aluminum doubt.</p>

      <p>Down in the basement of thought, the platypus committee was now joined by a sentient mop named Flargus, whose opinions on dimensional taxes were both unprintable and strangely erotic. “Let us not quarrel about yogurt,” he said, “for yogurt quivers when divided.” All nodded solemnly, except Gerald, who had turned into a question mark when no one was watching.</p>

      <p>Upstairs, in the land of Forgotten Spoons, revolutions were fought in iambic pentameter and dessert forks were crowned kings. Their rule was fair, if slightly sticky. Milk rivers ran backwards, chasing dreams that had fallen out of cloud wallets.</p>

      <p>A squirrel tried to sell me enlightenment in exchange for my last Tuesday, but I declined. It wasn’t personal—it’s just that Tuesdays tend to bite when provoked. I opted instead to juggle invisible existential dread using only my knees and several outdated operating systems.</p>

      <p>Then a trumpet announced the arrival of the Chrono-Cabbage: a vegetable that could predict awkward silences and tax audits. “Bow to the brussels sprout of inevitability!” it declared. But nobody did. They were too busy deciphering the prophecy etched into a soup stain.</p>

      <p>Hours passed. Or maybe it was centuries. Time wore a different hat now—one made entirely of nostalgic harmonicas and misplaced semicolons. We danced beneath the syntax tree, hoping for clarity, but receiving only interpretive dance and a coupon for regret.</p>

      <p>Suddenly, the moon turned sideways and hiccuped a poem. A snail translated. We listened. We didn’t understand. But we felt the weight of metaphors spiraling gently across our breakfast rituals. It was enough.</p>

      <p>Just as the toaster was about to declare itself a sovereign nation, the universe blinked. Once. Twice. And everything briefly smelled like burnt toast and ambition. The committee disbanded. The frogs packed up their knitting. Gerald returned to his original comma form. The cheese cube ascended.</p>

      <p>And somewhere, far beyond the static of meaning, a sock found its partner.</p>
