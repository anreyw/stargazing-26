    bio: "Award-winning author and historian Colleen Adair Fliedner will delve into the history and legends of Griffith Park and the life of Griffith J. Griffith as described in her latest book, “Fascinating True Tales from Old California.” Griffith tried to murder his wife, went to prison, and afterwards left his property to the City of Los Angeles. His vision was to use the rancho’s remaining land to benefit the “plain man” by transforming it into a beautiful park, building an observatory on Mount Hollywood, and creating a Greek-style outdoor theater. Who was Griffith J. Griffith-a philanthropist, a visionary, a self-serving madman? Colleen will explore the history of the site, and the multifaceted nature of Griffith, whose name endures through the park and brought him fame and immortality.",
